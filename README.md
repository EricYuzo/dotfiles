# DotFiles

I created this repository to store config files for my Debian system.

After a while, I wrote some setup scripts, just for fun and bash coding.

## Scripts

* `configure.sh`: setup my dot files;
* `install-packs.sh`: script to install a bunch of apt packages. The packages to install are defined in plain text files.
