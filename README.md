# DotFiles

I created this repository to store config files for my Debian system.

After a while, I wrote some setup scripts. Initially, I made them simple and straightforward. Then, I decided to make some of them more flexible. Even though I didn't need better scripts, I just did it for fun and bash coding.

## Scripts

* `configure.sh`: setup my dot files;
* `install-packs.sh`: script to install a bunch of apt packages. The packages to install are defined in plain text files.
